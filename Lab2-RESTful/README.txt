Authors: Tai Doan & Huyen Nguyen

	- Realtime Database of major soccer leagues, teams and players.
	- The service contains three levels of links, follows the convention of REST
	- Allows client to access to the endpoints, which is the name of the players

Client: Access the database using the GET method, and explore all child links from the "top level" set of links. The URL of current level is also displayed. When reaching the endpoints, the service returns the name of a player and client gets a goodbye message, and exit the program.
